Any contribution would be good to improve the api.

New easing functions can be implemented, same as new tween logic or any other feature correlated to this topic.

## Important !

Make a post in the [Issues](https://github.com/GianptDev/between-api-minetest/issues) panel first to explain with details about the new feature.

Make sure to write any changes in [CHANGELOG.MD](/CHANGELOG.md) before commit.

If you want to implement more easing function make a description to explain what the easing look like, see other interpolation functions as an example.
